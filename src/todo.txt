maintaining a graph and a text version of the program
 - graph manager?
 - actions: add node, set position, set A connected to B, change port weight [requests, not commands from gui]
 - graph checks: can A connect to B?
 - listeners to changes in graph?
 - should I save the actions or just graph state??????

port context menu: 1, -1, weight
port color depending on weight



- generator graphical interface in the main node
    - t1, t2, amplitude, etc.. can be changed by dragging or "scrubbing" :   || |  |  250  |  | ||
  

- plotting
  - simple line plots of var over time
  - invisible connections between plot and variable names?
  - resizable
  - test a few little plotting libraries, minimum possible!! just line plots and updating


- run button
- live run

--- GROUPING!!! very important. how to change graphics of elements when they 
   become a group;


   
done:

- constrain port location on the node edge
- make connections always between centers
